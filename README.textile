This is a gem that aims to provide simple PDF generation for a model using a basic DSL. 
The idea is to use a background image and tie an attribute from a model to a set of X-Y coordinates on the background.
Ideally there will be a web based XY selector at some point that will help create the DSL for you.
Associations will be supported through chained method calls.  Also, attributes returning arrays will also be supported
(for listing line items).
