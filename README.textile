h1. Receipt

This is a gem that aims to provide simple PDF receipt generation for a model using a basic DSL. 
The idea is to use a background image and tie an attribute from a model to a set of X-Y coordinates on the background.
Ideally there will be a web based XY selector at some point that will help create the DSL for you.
